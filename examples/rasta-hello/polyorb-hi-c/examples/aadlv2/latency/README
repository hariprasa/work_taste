Latency example
===============
The latency example defines five processes organized like this:

Process1 ---> Process2 ---> Process 3 ---> Process 4 ---> Process 5

So, each process receives data from its neighbor and send it to the next
thread. This example comes from the Software Engineer Institute.

There is two versions of our example. In the data port version, threads
and processes only use data port. In the event data port version, threads
and processes use event data port.

Currently, only the data port is correctly handled.

There is a list of files for each version

data port version
-----------------
* latency.aadl            : adapted example for Ocarina
* latency-original.aadl   : original version of the model

event data port version
-----------------------
* latency-event.aadl            : adapted example for Ocarina
* latency-event-original.aadl   : original version of the model
